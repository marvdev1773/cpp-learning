# C++ Learning Exercises

This repository contains my early C++ practice programs as I work through the fundamentals and build toward more advanced systems / quantitative development projects.

## Goals

- Build a solid foundation in modern C++ (syntax, types, control flow, functions, etc.)
- Get comfortable using VS Code, compilers, and the command line
- Practice good habits early: clean code, comments, and version control
- Prepare for future projects in:
  - systems programming
  - performance-sensitive C++ 
  - trading / quant-style simulations

## Current Contents

- `calculator.cpp` – simple console calculator that:
  - reads two numbers from the user
  - asks for an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
  - performs the operation using `if` / `else if` statements
  - handles division by zero

More small exercises will be added here as I progress through C++ basics.

## Tech & Tools

- Language: C++
- Editor: Visual Studio Code
- Version control: Git + GitHub

## Roadmap

This repo is focused on fundamentals and practice.  
Future, more advanced projects (e.g. simulations, backtesters, or trading-related tools) will live in their own dedicated repositories and be pinned on my GitHub profile.
